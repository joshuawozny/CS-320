# CS-320
<p>Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and
practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including
requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality
management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various
testing approaches will also be covered
</p>

## REFLECTION
### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
<p>Using engineering best practices helps ensure technically sound code. This includeds using the correct data structures to ensure that the the application efficiently uses resources,
using object-oriented techniques like inheritance to modularize code and keep code DRY. Unit and integration testing is used to ensure that software features are implemented correctly
and are behaving according to business rules.Using clean coding practices, good commenting, and self-documenting code through naming conventions, the current code base is in good shape and ready to be added to and get integrated into a larger application. As more code is developed, additional refactoring may be needed to ensure that the application can continue to be extended, and will be easy to understood by other developers. The unit tests will also aid other developers to understand the software requirements as they clearly outline what these classes are designed to do . </p>

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
<p>Developing software requires identifying and implementing system requirements. Through requirements gathering, we identify functional and nonfuntional requirements. 
This can be accomplished through interviews, brainstorming activities, and studying written documentation, as appropriate. An important step is to create test cases that help identify when 
software has met requirements.</p>

### How do I approach designing software?
<p>Software design requires careful consideration of user requirements and understading best practices to implement these while keeping the software maintainale and extensible.
Given an understanding of project scope including budget constraints, the first priority is to implement the key features udentified during requirements gathering. Nice-to-have features should only be implemented if sufficient time and resources exist, but should otherwise be postponed until resources can be allocated. It is important to keep in mind that resources for testing must be considered when allocating resources.</p>


## Project One
Develop a mobile application by delivering the contact, task, and
appointment services, and provide unit tests to verify that the
application meets the requirements.
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following
competency:
* Create unit tests using code to uncover errors

## Project Two
Create a follow-up summary and reflections report to explain the
analysis of various approaches to software testing based on
requirements and the application of appropriate testing strategies to
meet requirements while developing the mobile application.
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following
competencies:
* Analyze various approaches to software testing based on
requirements
* Apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements
