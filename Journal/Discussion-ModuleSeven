Released escapements and defects can range from minor bugs to major vulnerabilities 
causing serious and costly damages. One such incident occurred in 2017 at Equifax, 
one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, resulting in the 
exposure of sensitive personal and financial information of 147 million people. The 
breach was caused by a vulnerability in an software component that Equifax was 
using (Equifax Breach Exposes 143 Miilion Consumers' Data, 2017). 
Here are some key details about the breach:

- Date and Duration: The breach occurred between May and July 2017, 
and discovered on July 29, 2017. (Equifax Breach Exposes 143 Million Consumers' 
Data, 2017).

- Scope of Impact: The breach exposed sensitive data of approximately 147 million 
people, mainly from the United States but also including some from Canada and the 
United Kingdom. The data included names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, 
addresses, and driver's license numbers (Lam, B., 2017).

- Cause: The breach was caused by a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web 
framework, a flaw known as CVE-2017-5638. Equifax failed to patch this vulnerability 
in a timely manner, allowing Chinese hackers to exploit it and gain access to the 
company's systems (Equifax breach: How Chinese army hackers allegedly stole 
personal info, n.d.). 

- Detection and Response: ALthogh the breach was discovered on July 29, 2017, the 
company didn't publicly disclose the incident until September 7, 2017. The delayed 
disclosure and the company's handling of the incident drew criticism and raised 
concerns from about Equifax's security practices from consumers and government 
authorities (Lam, B., 2017).

- Impact and Consequences: The breach had significant consequences for individuals 
whose data was exposed. The compromised information could be used for identity 
theft, fraud, and other illegal activities. Equifax faced many lawsuits, 
government investigations, and public backlash due to the incident (Lam, B., 2017). 
The company also incurred significant financial costs, including fines, settlements 
and other considerable costs including $1.25 billion for "enhanced security and 
technology" from 2018 to 2020 (Equifax breach: How Chinese army hackers allegedly 
stole personal info, n.d.).

- Lessons Learned: The Equifax breach highlighted the importance of timely patching, 
robust security practices, and effective incident response. It served as a wake-up 
call for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and take proactive measures to 
protect sensitive customer data (Lam, B., 2017).
